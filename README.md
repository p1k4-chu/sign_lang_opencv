## Sign Language
✋ Sign Language Detection using OpenCV

A real-time sign language recognition system built using OpenCV, Deep Learning, and deployed as a Web App.
Our model achieves 97% accuracy on the test dataset, making it fast, reliable, and highly practical.

OVERVIEW
The goal of this project is to recognize hand gestures representing sign language alphabets/numbers using computer vision.
The system captures hand gesture images through a webcam, trains a classification model on custom-collected data, and performs real-time prediction via a web app.

We built a complete end-to-end pipeline:

Data collection using a custom script

Model training

Performance evaluation

Real-time prediction

Web-based interface for easy access
