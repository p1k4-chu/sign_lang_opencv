## Sign Language
The goal of this project is to build a real-time system that can:

Capture video using a webcam.

Detect and segment the hand region.

Extract features from hand gestures.

Classify gestures into predefined sign language symbols.

This project serves as a foundation for gesture-based communication systems and can be extended to full sign-language translation.
