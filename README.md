## 💡 Project Overview

The core goal of this project is to recognize hand gestures representing various **sign language alphabets/numbers** using computer vision techniques.

The system captures hand gesture images through a webcam, trains a classification model on custom-collected data, and performs real-time prediction via a web application.

## ✨ Key Features

* **High Accuracy:** The classification model achieves **97% accuracy** on the test dataset.
* **Real-Time Prediction:** Performs live sign language recognition via a web-based interface.
* **Complete ML Pipeline:** Includes custom components for every stage of the machine learning workflow.

## 🏗️ End-to-End Pipeline

This project implements a complete, self-contained machine learning pipeline:
* Data collection using a custom script.
* Model training.
* Performance evaluation.
* Real-time prediction.
* Web-based interface for easy access.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **OpenCV:** For computer vision tasks, image processing, and webcam integration.
* **Deep Learning (TensorFlow/Keras):** For building, training, and evaluating the classification model.
* **Python:** The core programming language.
* **Web Framework (e.g., Streamlit/Flask):** For deploying the real-time prediction web application (`webapp/app.py`).
